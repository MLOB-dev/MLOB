Description: Implements a regularized Bayesian approach that optimizes
    the estimation of between-group coefficients by minimizing 
    Mean Squared Error (MSE), balancing both variance and bias.
    This method provides more reliable estimates 
    in scenarios with limited data, offering a robust solution for 
    accurate parameter estimation in multilevel models. The package is designed for researchers 
    in psychology, education, and related fields who face challenges in 
    estimating between-group effects in two-level latent variable models, particularly
    in scenarios with small sample sizes and low intraclass correlation coefficients.
