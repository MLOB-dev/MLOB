Description: Implements a regularized Bayesian estimator that optimizes
    the estimation of between-group coefficients for multilevel latent variable models
    by minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE), balancing both variance and bias.
    This 'MultiLevelOptimalBayes' package provides more reliable estimates 
    in scenarios with limited data, offering a robust solution for 
    accurate parameter estimation in multilevel models. It is designed for researchers 
    in psychology, education, and related fields who face challenges in 
    estimating between-group effects in two-level latent variable models, particularly
    in scenarios with small sample sizes and low intraclass correlation coefficients.
